HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
This is a web-based system that contains three modules; user module and doctor’s module.
 In user module, the user will be the administrator who will be able to manage the whole system by adding the doctor’s credentials (name, staff number, phone number, email, password, subcounty, hospital) and manages the doctor by adding or deleting the information about the doctor.
The administrator also adds the Community Health Volunteers by inputting (name, phone number, subcounty, ward) and manages the Community
 Health Volunteer by adding or deleting the information about the CHV.
In the doctor’s module, the doctor will be able to log in using their personal credentials which are their email and password (the password is given by the administrator but they are able to change after logging for the first time.)
The doctor’s module has a dashboard that contains the incoming appointments(these are the appointments to be attended a day after), the current day appointments(the appointments on that day) and default appointments(the appointments that have not been attended for a number of days and the system automatically sends an SMS to the doctor and patient automatically)
The doctor is able to add the patient’s details(name, national id,gender,age,phone number,subcounty,ward)After the patient’s details are added, the doctor is able to make several tests considering the gender.If the patient is male, he will be tested the HIV/AIDs status(if he will be positive, doctor will be able to monitor him by sending a text  of the visit day to the hospital and track the ward and subcounty he is),height,weight,blood pressure.
If the patient is female, the doctor will make test (height, weight, anemia, edema, HIV status, fundal height, heart sound). If she if positive and not pregnant, she will be monitored by the system with the help of the doctor on the issues concerning regular checkups and advices through an SMS and track the ward and subcounty. Else if she is pregnant and positive, she will be monitored as well and the measures will be taken to ensure the foetus is taken care of such that he/she will not acquire the virus, track the next visitation and the subcounty and wards. The positive pregnant mother will also be receiving the SMS to alert her about the visitation days always.
